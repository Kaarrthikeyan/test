	    <h1> The Human disasters 
            <p>	 On the enthusiasm of celebrating the festivals the public(people) are destroyting the nature in a bad way such as spoling our surroundings in a drastic way.The people are not bothering about 
                 how they are the cause of such defects,as the time gets passing the nature of disastering is incresing rapidly.
                 Few examples of such problems is during VINAYAKA CHAVITHI , the people are using a idol of lord vinayaka which was made of plaster of paris which can pollute the water within a span of time .
                 the people protested against the govt to look so that they can reduce the product of idols.After an implementation of supplying of free idols which are made of clay and mud, the people are not 
                 showing interest of making use of clay idols.And also the people also make a lot of sound pollution which can disturb the near by schools,hospitals.
